# Ghostly Hollowing Crypter
Advanced in-memory process injection using transient SEC_IMAGE sections, custom crypter, and ADS payload delivery no disk traces, maximum stealth.

This project demonstrates a stealthy process injection method combining process hollowing, transient SEC_IMAGE sections, and in-memory payload decryption using a custom crypter. The payload is stored in an Alternate Data Stream (ADS), decrypted at runtime, and mapped into a suspended target process without ever touching disk in plaintext form. No PE dumping, no persistent artifacts, and minimal forensic footprint.

⚔️ Built for educational purposes, red team simulations, and research on modern malware evasion.

### Features:

    📦 Payload encryption with custom AES crypter

    🗂️ Storage in Alternate Data Stream (ADS)

    🔐 In-memory decryption only (no disk I/O)

    🧬 Section-based injection using NtCreateSection + NtMapViewOfSection

    🧩 Ghostly hollowing via transient file-backed SEC_IMAGE sections

    🧽 Cleanup of all traces (file handles, decryption key, etc.)

    ⚖️ Compatible with modern Windows x64 (NT-based systems)
